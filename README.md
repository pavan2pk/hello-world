# hello-world
our hello-world repository can be a place where you store ideas, resources, or even share and discuss things with others.
Github is an incredible resource for aspiring developers. Github hosts many of the greatest open source software projects ever created. Even better, you can create forks (copies) of the repositories, break the code, hack it and maybe even create the next best thing.  Not only that, but you can signup for a gitter account and ask questions to the people who created the projects you are interested in. It's really an invaluable resource.
